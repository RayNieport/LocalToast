- 1 instance of LocalToast (Running)
- 1 tasty recipe URL (from any major food site)
- 0 Ads or Pop-ups
- 0 Long-winded stories about my childhood
- A pinch of Docker

## Instructions
**Step 1: Add a Recipe**

Click the **+ Add** button in the top right. Paste a URL from a site like AllRecipes, FoodNetwork, or BBC Good Food. LocalToast will extract the title, image, ingredients, and instructions automatically.

**Step 2: Review and Edit**

Before saving, you'll see a preview. You can tweak the title, fix typo's in the ingredients, or add your own tags (like "dinner" or "spicy").

**Step 3: Cook**

Open a recipe on your phone or tablet. You can set the screen to stay awake automatically while you cook (Kitchen Mode).

**Step 4: Backup**

Your recipes are stored as simple files in the *recipes* directory. To backup your cookbook, just copy that folder to a safe place. You own your data.

**Step 5: Enjoy**

That's it! No accounts, no newsletters, just recipes.
